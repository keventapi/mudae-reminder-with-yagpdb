you can copy and past the code in your own custom command with the trigger type "starts with" and the command is mudae prefix

don't forget you need replace the "your number" to the minute who the rolls has benn reseted(have somes example in the code)

after this you can save and see the code work

if you replace other thing i don't know what's wrong, you can copy and past again the code and try again, if the error persist you can contact me on the discussion section

i maked this only for enjoy me but if you want use fell free
